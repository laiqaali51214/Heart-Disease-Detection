# Heart-Disease-Detection

This project is designed to guide you through the complete workflow of a machine learning project, from understanding the problem and preparing the data to training, evaluating, and fine-tuning a machine learning model. The goal is to predict heart disease diagnosis based on patient data, using real-world datasets and modern machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Conduct a complete end-to-end machine learning project.
- Use real-world data for training machine learning models.
- Perform data cleaning, visualization, preprocessing, and model training.
- Evaluate and fine-tune models for better performance.

### Tools/Software Requirements
- Google Colab
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Problem
The task is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various health-related features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. This is a binary classification problem, where the output label is either "0" (no heart disease) or "1" (heart disease).

### Getting the Data
The dataset used in this project is the **Heart Disease Dataset** from Kaggle. It contains 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, and more. The target variable is the diagnosis of heart disease.

### Loading the Data
The dataset can be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration and preprocessing. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Google Colab, or use the Kaggle API to directly download it in Colab.

## Key Concepts

### Data Exploration and Visualization
Before training a model, itâ€™s crucial to explore and visualize the data to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between features. This includes:
- Viewing the shape of the dataset.
- Checking for missing values.
- Generating summary statistics.
- Visualizing the distribution of the target variable and feature correlations.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data preparation involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and dealing with outliers. Proper data cleaning ensures that the model performs well and generalizes to new data.

### Model Selection and Training
For this binary classification problem, common models include:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

After selecting a model, it is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Model Fine-Tuning
To improve model performance, hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search. This helps find the optimal configuration of the model's parameters.

## Hands-On Workflow

### Data Exploration
- Use Pandas to load and explore the dataset.
- Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand feature distributions and correlations.

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values by either removing them or imputing with central statistics.
- Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scale numerical features using standardization or normalization.
- Identify and handle outliers.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics.

### Model Fine-Tuning
- Use Grid Search or Random Search to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.
- Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
